				<h1>Welcome to Linear</h1>
				<p>We're thrilled to have you with us. Linear will help you achieve pixel-perfect
				designs without getting in your way.</p>
			</header>

			<section class="step step--0">
				<p>In Linear, you work with <b>rulers</b>. Here is one. Go ahead, move it around :-)</p>
			</section>

			<section class="step step--1">
				<p>To manage your rulers, have a look at the <span class="lr"></span> icon in the menu bar,
					located at the top right corner of your screen. From there, you can create new rulers.
				You can create as many rulers as you want.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="step step--2">
				<p>Shortcuts are really useful! To create a new ruler, press ^⌘R. To hide/show (toggle) existing
				rulers, press ^⌘T . To close a ruler, press ⌘W.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="step step--3">
				<p>Right-clicking on a ruler lets you duplicate it. The duplicated ruler keeps the original ruler's size and general position.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="step step--4">
				<p>In the settings window (available from clicking the <span class="lr"></span> icon in the menu bar) you can change
				the displayed ruler's unit to either px or em.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="step step--5">
				<p>Thanks for your time. We hope you enjoy using Linear!</p>
